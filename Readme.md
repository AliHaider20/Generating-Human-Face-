Generating Human Faces is a project which generates human faces based on a given dataset of human faces.

Structure of the project :-

- Generator (Transposed Convolution) :- The purpose of the generator is to generate images closest to the real images in the dataset. Uses Tanh as activation function. 

- Discriminator (Convolution):- The purpose of the Discriminator is to discriminate the images generated by the Generator using the real images in dataset. Uses Sigmoid as an activation function.
